# Debian Customisations

This repository contains customisation scripts for my Debian installation.

* **enable-adwaita-qt:** Enables the Adwaita theme for QT applications.
* **enable-core-apps:** Enables a set of core applications on a standard Debian desktop installation.
* **enable-repos:** Enables a selection of repositories, including the [Debian Fasttrack repository](https://fasttrack.debian.net/).
* **enable-games:** Enables a selection of games. This is a separate script because I do not want games installed on my work computers.
* **update-system**: Updates the installation including DEB packages, flatpaks and upstream youtube-dl. Install to /usr/local/bin/update-system.
